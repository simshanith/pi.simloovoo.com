## [Chandra Samples Galactic Goulash](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/chandra-samples-galactic-goulash.html)

> This new composite image of Arp 299 contains [X-ray](http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/em_radiation.html) data from Chandra (pink), higher-energy X-ray data from NuSTAR (purple), and optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (white and faint brown). Arp 299 also emits copious amounts of infrared light that has been detected by observatories such as NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, but those data are not included in this composite.
