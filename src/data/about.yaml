  This website is the result of a technology-inspired project
  to connect a Raspberry Pi on a home network to the World Wide Web.

  As an avid technologist, I acquired a Raspberry Pi MAKE kit on a whim several years ago.
  It accumulated dust and survived untouched, until one day it beckoned me.

  After assembling the Pi and booting it up, I wondered what it could doâ€¦ Why not create a website detailing itself, a __diy metaverse__?
