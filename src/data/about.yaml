  This website is the result of a technology-inspired project
  to connect a Raspberry Pi on a home network to the World Wide Web.

  As an avid technologist, I acquired a Raspberry Pi MAKE kit on a whim several years ago.
  It accumulated dust and survived untouched, until one day it beckoned me.

  After assembling the Pi and booting it up, I wondered what it could doâ€¦ Why not create a website detailing itself, a ___diy metaverse___?

  While initially successful, the Raspberry Pi's SD card was lost after some other experimentation, and I haven't bothered to recreate just yet. In the meantime, enjoy the static site experience via Github.

  I hope to reconstruct the server stack directly on Pi, and self-document here. As it stands, this metaverse is more of a blueprint for a rapidly deployable Raspberry Pi static site setup.
